                        #WHAT IS SYSTEM?


- System is the aggregation or assemblage of objects arranged in  some regular interaction  to fullfill a task.
* eg- a classroom

                       #WHAT IS A MODEL?

- A body of information gathered for the purpose of studing the system

- The purpose of the study will determine the nature of the information,hence no unique model is there.

- It is used to predict:
  
* Test 
* Predict 
* Casualities
* investigate

                     #SYSTEM MODELING 
- It is the replica or duplicate copy of the system we wish to make, having all the characteristic of the system.

---

- It could be :

* Physical Model: It is the **3d** representation of the **system**

* Values can't be altered.

---

- **Further 2 types:**

* Mockup: That tells how the system will lool like.

* Prototype: How it'll work.

---

* Mathematical Model: Representation of the system on terms of **logical** & **quantitative** relationship that are manipulated to see how the system reacts.

---

                  #MATHEMATICAL MODEL CAN BE FURTHER DIVIDED INTO:

* Analytical Model: Virtually anything that can be measured.

- Arbitrary

- Typically large

- Probability/Statistics

---

* Simulation Model: 

- Composed of limited basic building blocks.

- Modest

- Algebra to stochastic process.
